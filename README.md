# Nudgy
This is Nudgy, an application meant to help you stay on track and get your work done on time. It consists of application tracking, a calendar to schedule your work, a To-Do list, and a timer. The name "Nudgy" comes from the ability for the app to "Nudge" you when you need to do work, or when it notices you are slacking off!

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.
