# Nudgy
This is Nudgy, an application meant to help you stay on track and get your work done on time. It consists of application tracking, a calendar to schedule your work, a To-Do list, and a timer. The name "Nudgy" comes from the ability for the app to "Nudge" you when you need to do work, or when it notices you are slacking off!

## Installation
See [Building](README.md#building).

Nudgy uses a SQLite database, stored locally in `nudgy_database.db`.
